<h2>About mhc</h2>

<p>This theme has been the personal project of <a href="http://somerandomdude.com">P.J. Onori</a> with the gracious <a href="#credits">help of many</a>. The theme was designed to provide a lightweight theme focused on the reading experience. mhc is the parent theme of <a href="https://github.com/somerandomdude/mhc-somerandomdude">mhc of Some Random Dude</a>, the theme I use on somerandomdude.com</p>

<h3>mhc is fast</h3>

<p>mhc&rsquo;s main focus is speed. The parent theme&rsquo;s default home page makes 9 database queries and consists of 2 requests weighing ~29Kb (9.3Kb gzipped). mhc keeps it basicâ€”no Javascript frameworks, no unnecessary images, just a simple, no-frills, screaming fast blog.</p>

<h3>mhc is flexible</h3>

<p>mhc has several different layouts to choose from for your home page. Most layouts let you specify the number of posts to show and from what categories. Templates can be stacked by any amount and order to give you the structure you need. Additionally, there are plenty of well-placed widgets that will give you that extra level of customization.</p>

<h3>mhc is forward-thinking</h3>

<p>mhc is built on HTML5 and CSS3. The theme strives for 100% valid HTML5 templates. One way mhc is so small is that it uses CSS3&rsquo;s effects and transitions to avoid unneeded images and Javascript. One side effect of this approach is that mhc does not support Internet Explorer 6 and <em>moderately</em> supports Internet Explorer 7 &amp; 8.</p>

<h3>mhc fits on your phone</h3>

<p>mhc uses a subset of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> to provide a responsive layout for desktops, tablets and phones. Add this to the theme&rsquo;s small footprint and you have a mobile-optimized blog.</p>

<h3>mhc is for you</h3>

<p>This theme is 100% open source and developer friendly. The parent theme (/mhc) is under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a>.</p>

<h3>mhc ain&rsquo;t finished</h3>

<p>There is always more to do, but I need help. This project relies on community support, so if you find this theme helpful, please contribute.</p>
